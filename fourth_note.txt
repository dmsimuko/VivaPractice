INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)

compiler and build process 
series of commands to programs such as compiler and linker to translate code to an executable program 


for larger projects:
mechanism for storing/sharing code
easily compile the code 

take control of compiler and build process 

how compiler works 

libraries 
cmake build system 

visual studio is a compiler from windows 

Compiling executable - Build process 

compiling -  human readable code to machine readable instruction 
linking  - links iunstructions as single code, adds data to create useful output like executable 

command line 

hello.cpp 
hello.o  =  compiled version of code 
hello.exe  = executable 

to link to g++ 
g++ hello.o -o hello.exe

to link 2 or more source files, use
g++ file1.o file2.o -o calc.exe 

this is done 

source code(.cpp) - compile - object files(.o) - link - output (.exe)

libraries -  packaged code that can be reused

static libraries 
dynamic libraries 

static libraries  - 
linked when project is built 
object file (.O)
g++ = (.a) 
static library = archive containing 1 or more object (.o) files 



dynamic libraries-
linked with the executable only when it is executed. happens at runtime
