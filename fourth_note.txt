INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)

compiler and build process 
series of commands to programs such as compiler and linker to translate code to an executable program 


for larger projects:
mechanism for storing/sharing code
easily compile the code 

take control of compiler and build process 

how compiler works 

libraries 
cmake build system 

visual studio is a compiler from windows 

Compiling executable - Build process 

compiling -  human readable code to machine readable instruction 
linking  - links iunstructions as single code, adds data to create useful output like executable 

command line 

hello.cpp 
hello.o  =  compiled version of code 
hello.exe  = executable 

to link to g++ 
g++ hello.o -o hello.exe

to link 2 or more source files, use
g++ file1.o file2.o -o calc.exe 

this is done 

source code(.cpp) - compile - object files(.o) - link - output (.exe)

libraries -  packaged code that can be reused

static libraries 
dynamic libraries 

static libraries  - 
linked when project is built 
object file (.O)
g++ = (.a) 
static library = archive containing 1 or more object (.o) files 
when compiling, must tell the compiler where to find header files that are included (I)
when linking the program, tell linker where to find libraries (L)

dynamic libraries-
linked with the executable only when it is executed. happens at runtime 
single copy of library exists on the computer and aplications dynamically link to and share library when run 
on windows these libraries are called (.dll) 
to build (.dll) >g++ -c adder.cpp -Dmaths_EXPORTS 
>g++ -shared adder.o -o libmaths.dll -Wl,--out-implib,libmaths.dll.a
