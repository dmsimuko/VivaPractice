Testing, documentation and automation 


testing - testing code with a number of test programes, use systems that will run tests on every change of code 
documentation - small projects, documentation can be done by choosing appropriate class, method, variabe names 
packaging - packaging the software need variables, libraries to be set and in the correct locations. depooyment technologies are used for that reason, to put things all together 

cTest: part of cmake, provides two services:
allows easy run all tests that supply with you package 
summarieses the results in dashboard that can be submitted to a webserver for easy inspection 

travis-ci:
a continuous integration service that can be set up to run a script everytime a code change is commited to repository. 
builds binaries and runs the tests. 

doxygen: tool that looks through source code for specially formatted comments meant to be included in the package documentation 
final results are a webpage, pdf document and bundles of ducuments. 

cpack: cpack is yet another component of the cmake ecosystem. provides a convinent way to gather executables, libraries, etc.
